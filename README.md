We call that star the "North Star" since it sits in the direction that the spin axis from the northern hemisphere of Earth points. At present, the star known as Polaris is the North Star. It was used by ancient navigators as a means of sensing the right direction.

Polaris is a General-Purpose Library for Java which will be compromised of tool-set which will help in crafting Simple but Robust Java-Based Softwares. The library is the successor to the Monosync Framework used in my Capstone Project.

Created under the organization of **Afterschool Creatives** founded by Department of Science and Technology Scholar Jhon Melvin Perello. The organization aims to INFORM, EDUCATE, and PROMOTE the usage of open-source platforms for students studying the same field in the Philippines. Polaris is  a stepping stone to start such movement that all of the IT students and related fields will be someday unified and collaborate in creating open-source platforms, softwares and products that will benefit the life of Filipino People.
